# Partial Class Example
The partial keyword indicates that other parts of the class, struct, or interface can be defined in the namespace. 
All the parts must use the partial keyword. All the parts must be available at compile time to form the final type. 
All the parts must have the same accessibility, such as public, private, and so on.
